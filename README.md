A python 2.7 script for NTU machine learning course

This script is written in python 2.7 with opencv 2.4.2

Before using this script, you need to install opencv first.

You can use sudo apt-get install python-opencv in ubuntu/debian.


This script has some useful functions like resize, show_image, bluro, out_put, draw, and many useless functions like everything else. TT

If you want to change the procedure you deal with your raw data, you need to get inside and modify the code( which is strongly against the software design principles).

But it's more possible that nobody would use it.
